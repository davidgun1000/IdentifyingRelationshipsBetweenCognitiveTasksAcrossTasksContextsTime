### READ ME FIRST ###

This OSF page contains Matlab code to estimate the cognitive models reported in:

Wall et al. Identifying relationships between cognitive processes across tasks, contexts, and time.

There are two directories containing code to reproduce the two applications reported in the manuscript: 
- Application 1: Correlations in latent processes in and out of the scanner.
- Application 2: Correlations in latent processes across different cognitive tasks.

We provide a README file in the directory "Application-1-scanner". This README file provides brief information about all scripts contained in the directory. We recommend starting with Application 1 and consulting the README file prior to using the scripts.

We do not provide a separate README file for Application 2 as the file structure is very similar to Application 1.
